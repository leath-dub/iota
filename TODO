* Only emit the first error at a given location
* (LOW PRIORITY) Add hook into `syntax_test` function to test that PEG parser can parse
  without error all inputs to test cases (it's probably overkill to actually
  check the syntax tree outputs are equivalent). This is just to catch
  divergance between actual compiler parser and PEG grammar.
