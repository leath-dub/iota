* Fleshing out 'sem'. Right now working on type resolution and checking.
  Will probably need pre-pass for global variables. Right now I am using
  exit function on each expression to validate them, which means post
  order validation from leaves up to the top of the tree.

The following inference feature:

```
let foo Some_Enum = ::bar;
```

Will work by setting `Some_Enum` as the inferred namespace in the context and
at type res/check time the `::bar` symbol will be resolved in this namespace
before having its type resolved.


* Remove unecessary passing of id to functions in syn
  - what node we are working on is now kept track of anyway with the new API
* Support all statements of the language
  - add more tests for them too (currently just basic if statement test)
* Support else postfix expression
  - new else statement for error handling
