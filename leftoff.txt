* Have a cleanup pass like before that will make designated initializers
  no longer expressions. This makes it easier to ignore them during name resolution
  as they need to be deferred to type  checking.

* Remove unecessary passing of id to functions in syn
  - what node we are working on is now kept track of anyway with the new API
* Support all statements of the language
  - add more tests for them too (currently just basic if statement test)
* Support else postfix expression
  - new else statement for error handling
