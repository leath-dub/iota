* Remove unecessary passing of id to functions in syn
  - what node we are working on is now kept track of anyway with the new API
* Finish work to remove old dump.c
  - we now have a way to describe the ast from syn.c (lower maintainence)
    implicitly by how we are parsing
* Support all statements of the language
* Support else postfix expression
  - new else statement for error handling
